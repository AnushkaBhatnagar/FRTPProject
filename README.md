**About the Project:**

You Matter is a static website which serves as a one-stop platform for mental health resources pertaining to self-care, contacts of registered practitioners, online mediums, and articles to educate oneself. Hosted on Azure, this site will help visitors reach the resources and find relevant information in the domain of mental healthcare. The resources are beneficial as they redirect the users to official sites, mediums and articles where they can gain significant knowledge and seek the help they need through professionals and registered medical practitioners. Being mindful of one's mental health and maintaining positivity is of vital significance and it is important that we learn to take care of ourselves as well as of others so as to lead a better and healthy lifestyle.
